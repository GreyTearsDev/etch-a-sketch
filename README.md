Transform the behavior of a square when interacting with the 
mouse by introducing a series of modifications.

Rather than a simple color change from black to white, 
each interaction should randomize the square’s RGB value 
entirely.

Additionally, implement a progressive darkening effect 
where each interaction adds 10% more black or color to 
the square. The objective is to achieve a completely 
black square only after ten interactions. (Research about alfa color. probably will have to store the initial value in a variable and 
whenever the event is triggered, increment the value of the alpha by ten percent (0.1))

You can choose to do either one or both of these 
challenges, it’s up to you.
