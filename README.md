# etch-a-sketch
Another project from The Odin Project's curriculum

Set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would.
    
    Hint: “Hovering” is what happens when your mouse enters a div and ends when your mouse leaves it. You can set up event listeners for either of those events as a starting point.
    
    There are multiple ways to change the color of the divs, including:

        adding a new class to the div.
        
        changing the div’s background color using JavaScript.
